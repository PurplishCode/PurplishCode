// error in JS!
// Important lesson.


// error = is an object with a description of something went wrong.
// throw = executes an user-defined error. (We're the ones in command)



// we "try" executing some errors and trials. You can add logic onto many cases (suchas IF users input NaN on Numerical field, etc.)
try{
    w1 = window.prompt("Enter your #");
    w1 = Number(w1);
    
    if(isNaN(w1)) throw `${w1} isn't a number, try again.`;
    if(w1 == "") throw `Please input a number.`;
    
    console.log(`${w1} is a number`);
    
    } catch(error){
      console.log(error);
    }
    finally {
      console.log("This code will executes no matter if the program / syntax failed or succesful.");
    }
