// FUNCTION!
// One of the most important piece of lessons, function() is helpful to call upon syntax of code
// Without creating it again. Write once, call anytime!

// function() also supports global variable, but if within the function declares a variable, it'll be only sets for the local function.
// Unless you're explicitly throws it onto another function.. But it depends on which goes first or whatnot.

let name= "darell";
let age= 16;


withinName();

function withinName() {
    let userName = "ilham";
    let age= 14;

    callBirthday(userName, age);
}

function callBirthday(userName, age) {
    console.log("Happy birthday, " + name);
    console.log("Happy birthday aswell, " + userName + ". You're " + age + " years old!");
}

// To call the function, you'll have to write the function names with the sets of parenthesses.
