// Variable scope

// LET vs VAR


// Let is limited within the curly brackets {},
// Var is limited within the function(), basically you couldn't call the variable since it isn't a global variable anymore.

letsPlay();

function letsPlay() {
    for(let i = 1; i <= 3; i+= 1) {

    }
}


console.log(i); // This syntax still won't acquire the let i variable, even though it's within the curly brackets of function, it's still reffered as local scope only for-loop.


var name = "darell";

// Var keyword indirectly alters the window property, to check it.. Simply insert window on your webpage console, preferebly your OWN webpage (Localhost)
