// FOR-LOOP STATEMENT
// For-loop is used to loop through codes for certain amount of time.

// For(The count is 10, the count will eventually stop until it's greater or equals to zero.)
/* for(let i=10; i > 0; i+=-1) {
    console.log(i);
}
console.log("Happy new years!");

// Break and continue of Loop statemnt.
// We could stop the syntax of code until it reaches a specific amount, let's say for-looping until 15, then we'll break after it reaches 10.
// There's also a code If we wanted to skip the iteration of the code, but it'll still continue until it reaches the designated amount with continue.

for(let i= 10; i >= 0; i+=-1) {
    if(i == 10) {
        continue;
