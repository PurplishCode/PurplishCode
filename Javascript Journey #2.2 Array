// Uh-oh, lessons of array!

// Array can store many values into single variable.

let fruit = ["apple","banana","guavacado"]; // The value insides of array is called elements.

// If we wanted to specifically invoke value, add "[]" then insert the index.

// fruit[3] = "orange"; // This'll add the value of orange into the specific index.

// but IF fruit[0], then it'll replace the value of existing index 0 into orange.

fruit.push("melon"); // .push() method adds another value onto the arrays.

fruit.pop(); // .pop() method DELETES the last element of arrays.

fruit.unshift("durian"); // .unshift() method adds another value in the beginning of arrays.

fruit.shift() // .shift() method also DELETES the first element of an array, simillar to .pop() with its counterpart .push()


let length = fruit.length; // The length of an array.

fruit = fruit.indexOf("apple"); // The index of the elements apple.

// OR

// let fruit2 = ["watermelon"];

// fruit = fruit2.concat(fruit); // This'll add the value of fruit2 (watermelon) into fruit arrays.


console.log(length);

console.log(fruit);



// Looping with Array!

// Simple For-loop iteration.
let arr = [5,10,15,20];

// Arr is our arrays, we'll create for-loop statement. i sets to 0, 'i' will continue until it reaches arr.length (Which is 3), then it'll increment by 1.
// if 'i' is equal to 1 (10 in elemets of array), it'll stop the code or "break"
// We'll display it the arrays with [i]. 
/* for(let i=0; i <= arr.length; i+=1) {
    if(i == 1) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
*/


// Backward Array.

// We'll create an 'i' variable sets as arr.length(which is 3) then it'll minus by 1, i will continue until it's greater or equals to 0, then decremenet the i with (-=)
for(let i= arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i-=1) {
    if(i == 1) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(arr[i]);
}

// Sorting array of strings element!


let vehicle = ["Toyota","Honda","Yamaha"];

// vehicle = vehicle.sort(); // This'll sort the elements by it's alphabetical
// vehicle = vehicle.sort().reverse(); // Same thing but reversed.


for(let count of vehicle) {
    console.log(count);
}


// 2D Array! An array made of with array.
                    // ---> --> ---> Is what we call column.

                    let toys =       ["chessboard","rubic","doll"];

                    // This is our 2D array, we store buncha arrays into big chunks.
                    let gameStore = [videogames, toys, virtualgames];
                    
                    
                    // Time to alter singular elements within the big chunks of array indences.
                    
                    
                    // Reminder: Computer reads indexes from 0.
                    gameStore[0][0] = "GTA"; // row x column, this is called indences. We invoke the specific elements of array.
                    // This'll alter the column 0 of rows 0 (which is videogames array, and roblox elements.)
                    
                    
                    for(let games of gameStore) {
                        for(let itemStore of games) {
                        console.log(itemStore);
