// asynchronus and synchronus!!
// Important lessons.

// Synchronus => In an Ordered sequences.
//               Step-by-Step Linear Instructions.
//                Start now, Finish now!

// Example: It'll go down step-by-step until it's finished.. If the first step isn't done, next-step will have to wait.

/*

console.log("Start");
console.log("Our method or anything.");
console.log("Finish");

// Asynchronus => Out of order sequences.
//                Ex. Accessing Database.
//                     Fetch File.
//                     Task that takes time.
//                      Start now, finish sometimes later.

// It doesn't go any order. If step two hasn't finished, it'll finish sometime later but the programs (next-step) will keep continue.
console.log("Start program");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Asynchronus code loaded in!"), 4000);
console.log("End Program");

// console.time() method! => Keeping track of operators time.
// Starts a time you can use to track how long an operation. Give each timer an unique name!




// .time and .timeEnd method will tracks how long a synchronus program takes. It'll not wait around for programs to load (or such, asychronus).

console.time("START");


alert("How long..");

console.timeEnd("START");
